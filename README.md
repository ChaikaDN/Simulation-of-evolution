# Simulation of evolution

Press SPACE to pause ahd 1 - 4 to chande speed.

In this simulation, bot cells evolve through natural selection.
In the process of evolution, a cell can become a predator, eating neighbors, or remain a peaceful photosynthetic creature.
It can rush around the field in all directions, or sit still, saving vital energy. It all depends on the will of chance and pseudo-random numbers. :)
The color of the cell depends on its lifestyle. Photosynthetic - green, Predators - red.

At the start, cells can only photosynthesize. If you see that the cell has started to move, it has evolved!
